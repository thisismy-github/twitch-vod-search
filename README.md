# Twitch VOD Search
Simple command-line tool to search VODs for specific search terms.

Input your options in the terminal or include these parameters:
- -u (--user): Desired Twitch channel to retrieve VODs from.
- -c (--count): How many most recent VODs to search through.
- -s (--search): Keyword to search for.
- -t (--realtime): Add the real-world time that a comment was posted at, as opposed to just the time relative to the start of the VOD.
	
TODO:
- More search options
- More efficient vod retrieval
- GUI and/or web client instead of command-line interface
- Option to save results
